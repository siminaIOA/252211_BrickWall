# 252211_BrickWall (GitHub Pages)

This branch hosts the built site for the live demo.

## Highlights
- Parametric wall controls: brick length/width/height, wall length, gaps (vertical/horizontal), rows, and falloff.
- Curve Control Panel with two modes: Catmull-Rom (add/move/delete points) and Polyline (add/move/delete points on any segment) with sharp interior corners and 1:1 proportions between editor and wall.
- Attractor-driven falloff plus physics collapse simulation.
- Exports: OBJ/PLY with vertex colors; Snapshot saves the scene + UI.

## Live Demo
- Main demo: https://siminaioa.github.io/252211_BrickWall/

## Deployment
This branch is static output only. To rebuild from source:
1) Checkout the source branch (e.g., `main` or `feature/preview-share`).
2) Install deps once: `npm install`.
3) Build: `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/` with relative asset paths).
4) Copy the contents of `dist/` into the root of the `gh-pages` branch (overwrite existing files).
5) Commit and push `gh-pages`: `git add -A && git commit -m "Deploy latest build" && git push origin gh-pages`.
GitHub Pages will serve from the branch root using the relative assets generated by Vite.
